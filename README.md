# sql-learning

## About
This repo tracks my learning journey. It contains exercises, queries, and sample databases designed to practice data extraction, transformation, and reporting.

The goal is to gain confidence writing queries for real-word datasets, analyzing data efficiently, and building reusable SQL workflows.

## What's inside?
`queries/` - practice SQL queries on sample datasets
`schemas/` - database structures and tables used for exercises
`projects/` - small projects combining queries for analysis or reporting
`notes/` - explanations of concepts, best practices, and optimizations

## Learning Goals
- Understand relational database concepts and normalization
- Master querying and filtering, joins, and aggregations
- Apply SQL to practical reporting and data manipulation tasks

## For You: How to use
- Examine query examples for learning
- Test queries on provided sample datasets
- Contribute corrections or suggestions for optimization. Let's collaborate.
